# Teleo-Reactive-Java-v1
This Java program executes a Teleo-Reactive program with a very simple syntax as shown in the example. From main, it emulates the existence of an observer that receives notifications from the Teleo-Reactive program so that it knows when a durative action starts, when it ends, and when a discrete action is executed.
